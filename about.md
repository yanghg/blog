#### About Me
<br>
I'm Yang, a master student of Computer Science at Northwestern Uiversity at present. This is the last quarter of my master degree and I have started looking for a `full time` job in the United States. 

I love to solve different problems, individually or in a team. Now I have several interest areas: front end coding, java and data analysis. By an odd coincidence, I got most coding experience in front end part: stuff in `angular, react, responsive design, nodejs + express, webpack ...`

My goal for future career is to become a full stack engineer or senior software architect, I think to output a fancy product with the combination of differnt skills or to view a product from broad view are really fun. However, I don't mind to become a front end developer, java developer or data analyst at the very beginning. You know step by step is the only way towards success.

If you want to chat with me on products, skills or career, you can find me through following methods:
